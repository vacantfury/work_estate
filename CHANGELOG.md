# Changelog

All notable seed changes, one entry per version. Versions are SemVer git tags: MAJOR = a convention reversed or restructured (existing derived layers must regenerate), MINOR = additive (new modules or module sections), PATCH = wording or fix. Each entry names the changed modules and the derived layers they affect — this file is the manifest the update mode (`UNFOLD.md` §Updating an installed estate) reads against the installed version.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-24

- Added: the seed clone is itself REGISTERED in the hub's estate registry as the estate's one evolving external dependency (kind: seed): clone path · installed version · update-channel state (A2) · last checked · last applied. The update mode's check and apply steps write this row, so the hub traces seed updates and pending ones surface through the ordinary attention view; the check may register as a low-cadence A2-gated engine job, apply always waits for the user.
- Affects: hub founding (UNFOLD Phase 3 step 1) and the update procedure. Installed estates: add the seed row on the first update run (bootstrap line included); no generated layer regenerates, no living state touched.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-24

- Added: `corpus/resources.md` — **Events** as the fifth resource kind: internal events are windowed, decided-never-drifted-into; each candidate gets one attendance read per the data-shape rule (learning · visibility · people, against time cost) ending in an attend/skip recommendation; yields route to `company-watch.md` and the people cards.
- Added: `corpus/estate-structure.md` not-ported line now names the shared scoring/discovery-service absence by decision (the data-shape rule carries the scoring discipline in place, in each register).
- Affects: the derived layers of `resources.md` and `estate-structure.md` (wording plus one new register kind; the resources A5 row already covers it — no new row). No living state touched.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-24

- Fixed: `portable-skills.md` §day-start orientation step 2 now cites `communication-flow.md` as the one home of the inbox check (the triage sweep; the entry predated that module) — prevents a parallel hand-rolled inbox pass.
- Affects: the portable-skills-derived layer, wording only; no new A5 row, no living state touched.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-24

- Added: `corpus/portable-skills.md` §generalize-at-settle — the third settle-time transform alongside capture-at-settle and workflow-extraction: two axes (scope promotion up the estate ladder · parallel sweep across analogous surfaces), applied the same sitting; the work-side ladder tops out at the hub's own conventions, corpus candidates travel upstream only (one-way flow). Plus one write-phase line in §improvement-loop dispatch.
- Affects: the derived instruction/skill layer generated from `portable-skills.md` — one new A5 row (adopt expected; it costs nothing to hold). No other module changed; no living state touched.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-24

Baseline release: the full corpus through the 2026-08-20 passes (estate founding, steward-mind hub, autonomy gradient, translation completeness), plus this pass's update machinery.

- Added: versioned delta updates — `UNFOLD.md` §Updating an installed estate (check → delta apply → advance the `HEAD` marker; provenance headers; never a full re-unfold), this `CHANGELOG.md`, design principle 24.
- Affects: no corpus module changed; no derived layer regenerates. The first update run on an installed estate applies only the update convention itself (provenance headers appear lazily as layers next regenerate).
